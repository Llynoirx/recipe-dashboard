# Web Development Project 5 - *Recipe Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Kathy Ho**

This web app: **Leverage the Spoonacular Recipe API to create a dynamic recipe list that analyzes and filters categories such as cuisine, diet, and intolerances through search. The application will then present a comprehensive summary of the recipes, including statistics like mean ready time, mean servings, and average health score rating**

Time spent: **6.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [x] meanReadyTime, meanServings, meanHealthScore
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [ ] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!
 - Added loading screen 
 - Display 'No results found' for queries not available in the database
 - Can apply just a couple of the filters (ie. 1-2) instead of all of the filters
